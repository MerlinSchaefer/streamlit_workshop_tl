# Resources for the TechLabs Streamlit Workshop 2020

If you want to participate in the workshop on Sunday (13.12.2020) please clone the repot (or download the resources) **before** the workshop.

If you have any trouble please reach out to me via the known channels.

You can have a look at the provided files, they are however probably not self-explanatory. That's what the workshop is for.
We will code in the code_along_exercises.py and use the datasets and model.pkl within our application.
The db_stocks is just a quick (but slow loading..) example, I will provide more within the workshop. 
The model_train.py is just the script that trains the model. You won't need it, unless you want to make a better model for some reason.


After the workshop is finished I will upload a full version of the code.
